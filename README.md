**ZeroWasteChef** was submitted for the KitaHack 2025 hackathon under team AMU. We believe ZeroWasteChef offers a practical solution to address the growing issue of food waste by empowering individuals to make smarter choices about their food consumption, directly contributing to  **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** ♻️ and indirectly supporting **SDG 13: Climate Action 🌍**.
